# Quality of Life Interface Tools

Quality of Life Interface Tools is a mod that aims to make the player's life easier, by reducing the amount of needless micromanagement and clicking through clean, intuitive, and responsive interfaces.

# Features

## Global Edict Commander

Global Edict Commander is a tool that makes setting state edicts a seamless experience. With just a few clicks, the player can set a variety of different state edicts across multiple continents worth of states.

### Smart Edicts

Instead of mindlessly applying state edicts everywhere, or spending a good chunk of time finding the best state for a given edict, the player can use smart edicts to apply state edicts efficiently. All of the state edicts, bar one, have smart edict options available for them.

### Quick Select Options

If you find yourself using a smart edict often, you don't have to go through an event every time just to select it. You can simply go into the **settings** and select which option you want pre-loaded. After selecting the option, it will be executed every time you click the edict button.

### Reactive Edicts
Reactive Edicts allow you to configure certain state edicts to be turned on or off in states whenever certain things happen within the game. For example, you can have it automatically turn on the Encourage Development edict in a state whenever you develop a province that's in a state. You can have the Defensive Edict turned on in a state if the state has a fort and a province was sieged by the enemy.

You can configure which reactive edicts are enabled by default on every game startup by doing the following:

1. Navigate to the mod folder (This can be done easily through the Paradox Launcher. Just find the mod in your playset, hover over it with your cursor, click the "..." button that appears, and then click "Show in Folder").
2. Search for the file `reactive_edict_config.txt` in your system's file manager. Alternatively, navigate to the `common\on_actions` folder.
3. Open `reactive_edict_config.txt` with a text editor, like Notepad.
4. The file contains a guide on how to configure reactive edicts for every game, so refer to that from here on.

Tired of having to delete hundreds of forts built by the AI every time you finish conquering them so your economy doesn't crash? With this tool you can delete all the forts in your country in just two clicks. You can also whitelist forts you have set up in strategic locations so the tool doesn't delete them.

## Autonomy Lowering Macro

This tool allows you to lower the autonomy of all possible provinces in just a few clicks. You can also fine tune the search criteria by setting the minimum autonomy reduction required and the minimum development for each province.

## Exploit Development Macro

# Compatibility

This mod will likely not work with other mods that modify the user interface, specifically if your mod has a modified **_provinceview.gui_** file.

I've made compatibility patches for popular mods, [you can find them here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3452570071).

# Permissions

You are free to use the code and assets in this mod for your own mod, so as long as you credit me.
