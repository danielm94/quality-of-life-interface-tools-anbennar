# Global Edict Commander

A Europa Universalis IV mod that allows you to manage state edicts at a global level through a specialized interface. The mod provides a streamlined way to set or remove edicts across all states without having to open the province interface each time.

## Installation

You can install the mod in two ways: by cloning the repository via Git or by downloading a ZIP file.

### 1. Installing via Git

1. **Open a terminal** (or command prompt) in the folder where you want to store the mod.
2. **Clone the repository** using one of the following URLs:

   - **SSH**:
     ```
     git clone git@github.com:danielm94/global-edict-commander.git
     ```
   - **HTTPS**:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/danielm94/global-edict-commander.git
     ```

3. Once the repository is cloned, **copy or move the `global-edict-commander` folder** and the `descriptor.mod` file to your EU4 mods directory, typically found at: `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod`
4. Rename the descriptor.mod file to the `<mod_folder_name_goes_here>.mod`. E.g., if your mod folder is located in `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod/global-edict-commander`, then you will name it `global-edict-commander.mod`.
5. The mod should now be listed as one of the available mods inside of Paradox launcher. Add it to one of your playsets.

### 2. Installing Without Git

1. **Click “Code”** (the green button) and choose **“Download ZIP”**.
2. **Extract** the downloaded ZIP file.
3. **Copy or move the extracted folder** and the `descriptor.mod` to your EU4 mods directory, typically: `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod`
4. Rename the descriptor.mod file to the `<mod_folder_name_goes_here>.mod`. E.g., if your mod folder is located in `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod/global-edict-commander`, then you will name it `global-edict-commander.mod`.
5. The mod should now be listed as one of the available mods inside of Paradox launcher. Add it to one of your playsets.

## Usage

- After enabling the mod, load your save or start a new game.
- Click on a province that you own that is part of a state.
- On the right hand side of the province window, you will notice a new tab. Click it to open the global edicts window. Alternatively, press shit+d
- Once the panel is open, you can select an edict by clicking on one of the buttons. If you are unsure which edict is which, you can hover over them for more details.
- After selecting an edict, it will be applied to every single state in your country. You will not be able to use Global Edict Commander until after a year has passed, much like how state edicts work with vanilla.

You are free to use my mod in your own mod, so as long as you credit me. This mod is still a work in progress so report any bugs you find here.
