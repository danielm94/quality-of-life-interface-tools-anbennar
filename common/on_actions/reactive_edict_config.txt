# Configure which reactive edicts you want on by default here.
# To enable or disable a reactive edict, add or remove the '#' character from the start of the line.
#
# For example, let's say that I always want to enable the "Encourage Development" edict whenever I develop a province in all of my games.
# To do that, make sure the code below in the "on_startup" block has "set_country_flag = reactive_edict_development_setter"  and not "# set_country_flag = reactive_edict_development_setter"
# 
# Do note that whenever the mod is updated whether it be through Steam Workshop or you pulling the latest changes from GitHub, this config will revert to its default state and you will need to reconfigure it.
